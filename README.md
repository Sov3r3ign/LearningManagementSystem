# LearningManagementSystem
In a learning management system project, we are required to create some functionality, 
including CRUD operations. We have been tasked to develop an application which manages 
student tasks. An instructor should be a to add tasks for students. A task should have a 
taskID, taskName, dueDate, and a module where the test is for. A module should have a 
moduleID, moduleName, and the duration for the module. Modules should be added by an
admin. Students should also be added by the admin, and students should have a studentID, 
studentName, studentSurname, and the Dob. Students and instructors should be able to 
sign into the system to access different functionalities.
